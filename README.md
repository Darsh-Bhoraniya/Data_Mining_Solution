### Lab 01 to Lab 04 Solutions

This repository contains solutions to Python exercises and implementations of various machine learning and data mining algorithms. Below is a list of the key algorithms covered in each lab:

1. **Apriori Algorithm**  
   - A popular algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and discovering association rules between variables in large datasets.

2. **FP-Growth Algorithm**  
   - An efficient algorithm for frequent pattern mining that avoids the costly candidate generation step in Apriori.

3. **Decision Tree Algorithm**  
   - A supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions in the form of a tree.

4. **Naive Bayes Theorem**  
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

5. **Gini Index**  
   - A metric used to evaluate splits in decision tree algorithms. The lower the Gini Index, the better the split.

6. **K-Means Algorithm**  
   - A popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.


7. **K-Medoids Algorithm**  
   - Similar to K-Means, but instead of using centroids, it uses actual data points as centers of the clusters, making it more robust to outliers.
