# ðŸš€ Data Mining Solution

This repository contains Python solutions and implementations for various  data mining algorithms covered across multiple labs.

---

## ðŸ“Š Lab 5: Apriori Algorithm

- **Apriori Algorithm**  
  - A popular algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and discovering association rules in large datasets.

---

## ðŸŒ² Lab 6: FP-Growth Algorithm

- **FP-Growth Algorithm**  
  - An efficient algorithm for frequent pattern mining that avoids the costly candidate generation step in Apriori.

---

## ðŸŒ¿ Lab 7: Decision Tree Algorithm

- **Decision Tree Algorithm**  
  - A supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions in the form of a tree.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Lab 8: Naive Bayes & Gini Index

- **Naive Bayes Theorem**  
  - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

- **Gini Index**  
  - A metric used to evaluate splits in decision tree algorithms. The lower the Gini Index, the better the split.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab 9: K-Means Algorithm

- **K-Means Algorithm**  
  - A popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab 10: K-Medoids Algorithm

- **K-Medoids Algorithm**  
  - Similar to K-Means, but instead of using centroids, it uses actual data points as centers of the clusters, making it more robust to outliers.
